        """A concordance is an alphabetical list of the usage of a *key word* within a significant text (or body of texts), such as the Christian Bible or the works of Shakespeare. 
    A concordance is useful for close-reading and textual analysis since it gathers together every context for the use of a particular word or phrase. For example, we could see
    every context in which Shakespeare mentions the color "red", the concept of "allegiance", or the feeling of "jealousy," revealing the way he framed and understood them. 
    To use the Christian Bible as an example, we could find every example of a particular term in Biblical Hebrew or Aramaic and discover how they might be translated into the King James's Version.

## Using Key Word in Context (KWIC) for visualizing concordances
The most common way to visualize a concordance is a type of index called Key Word in Context, or KWIC. We can generate a KWIC index for any key word using text analysis. The
index places the key word in a central column within a "context window," a chosen number of words or characters that occur both before and after the given word."""

    The body of materials could represent the works of a single author (such as Toni Morrison), a community of writers (2010s rappers), a period (19th century newspapers), or some other category. 
    A KWIC can help us go beyond word frequencies by giving the context of the word use for future analysis. Using a concordance usually means combining distant reading (in this case, algorithmically collating
    the contexts) with close reading (examining word choice and meaning in detail). After the KWIC index is created, the scholar can analyze the contexts for their research.
